{"id":"mcpIndexer-106","title":"Implement parallel file processing for parsing/chunking","description":"**Goal**: Process multiple files concurrently during parsing and chunking phases to utilize multi-core CPUs.\n\n**What we're accomplishing**: Currently files are processed sequentially. Using multiprocessing can:\n- Utilize all CPU cores for parsing/chunking\n- Achieve 3-5x speedup on 4-8 core systems\n- Reduce indexing time for large repositories\n\n**Impact**: Faster initial indexing and reindexing. A 1000-file repo could index in 20% of current time.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Use multiprocessing.Pool for file processing\n- Parse and chunk files in parallel workers\n- Collect results and batch for embedding\n- Handle errors gracefully across processes\n- Add worker count configuration option","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-27T18:13:39.301746-05:00","updated_at":"2025-10-28T13:39:15.426014-05:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T13:39:15.426014-05:00"}
