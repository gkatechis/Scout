{"id":"mcpIndexer-109","title":"Implement incremental file-level reindexing","description":"**Goal**: Only reindex files that have actually changed instead of reindexing entire repositories.\n\n**What we're accomplishing**: Currently when commits change, entire repos are reindexed. File-level tracking would:\n- Detect which specific files changed between commits\n- Only parse/chunk/embed modified files\n- Remove old chunks and add new ones\n- Reduce reindex time by 90%+ for typical changes\n\n**Impact**: Near-instant reindexing for small changes. A 10-minute full reindex becomes 5-10 seconds for a few file changes.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Track per-file commit hashes or modification times\n- Use git diff to detect changed files\n- Implement chunk deletion by file_path\n- Update only changed files in ChromaDB\n- Handle file deletions and renames\n- Test with various git scenarios","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-27T18:13:55.781096-05:00","updated_at":"2025-10-27T19:20:21.983811-05:00"}
