{"id":"mcpIndexer-104","title":"Switch to code-specific embedding model (jina-embeddings-v2-base-code)","description":"**Goal**: Replace the general-purpose embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with a code-specialized model to improve semantic search quality for code.\n\n**What we're accomplishing**: The jina-embeddings-v2-base-code model is specifically trained on 150M+ code Q\u0026A pairs and supports 30+ programming languages. It offers:\n- Better semantic understanding of code vs natural language\n- 8K token context window (vs 512) for larger code chunks\n- Improved accuracy for code search queries\n\n**Impact**: Higher quality search results, better symbol matching, improved cross-repo dependency detection.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Update DEFAULT_MODEL in embeddings.py\n- Test with existing indexed repos\n- Document model selection rationale\n- Add configuration option for model choice","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-27T18:13:28.385434-05:00","updated_at":"2025-10-27T18:30:57.20244-05:00","closed_at":"2025-10-27T18:30:57.20244-05:00"}
